# chingariDapp
It's an attempt to make a Dapp on ethereum, where:
Users can watch, Like, Share, Comment, Tip a Video
Users can Upload video content, which will be Tokenised with Videos stored in any Decentralized storage, Likes, Shares, Views, Comment Tipping History,  
Users can Buy Tokenised videos with Regular bidding mechanism as used in any NFT Marketplace, Should also be available for secondary trades.
Video NFT Attributes should be categories of video (Comedy, Dance, Music, Travel,Lipsync etc),Video duration, demographic & language & These attributes can be used by viewers to filter videos Kind of similar to creator cuts 
Video Creators should have an optional feature to add Utility to their Tokenised video. It can be a Revenue sharing with the holders earned through tips, Likes, Share, Views & Comment. Exclusive video rights etc. which can be done through Whitelisting the Holders.
